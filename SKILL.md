# Tribe Building Framework

Design and nurture a tribe or movement around a product, cause, or leader, based on Seth Godin's methodology from "Tribes."

**Token Budget:** ~700 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help build tribes around harmful ideologies or movements
- Design manipulation tactics that exploit group psychology
- Create cult-like dependency structures

**If the purpose is harmful:** Decline and explain why tribes require ethical foundations.

---

## When to Use

- Building community around a product or brand
- Creating a movement for a cause
- Developing a personal platform or following
- User asks: "How do I build my tribe?" "Create a movement" "Build community around my work"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `core_idea` | Yes | The belief or cause at the center |
| `existing_community` | No | People already engaged |
| `leader_identity` | No | Who's leading (you or someone else) |
| `communication_channels` | No | How you reach people |

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define the Tribe Core

A tribe needs only two things: **a shared interest** and **a way to communicate.**

But a movement needs three elements (Senator Bill Bradley, via Godin):

| Element | Your Answer |
|---------|-------------|
| **1. A narrative** | What's the story about who we are and the future we're building? |
| **2. A connection** | How do members connect to each other and to the leader? |
| **3. Something to do** | What action can members take? (Fewer limits = better) |

### Step 2: Identify the Shared Belief

The tribe rallies around a belief, not a product.

**"People like us ______ because we believe ______."**

Examples:
- "People like us blog daily because we believe in shipping work."
- "People like us avoid mass marketing because we believe in earning attention."
- "People like us make remarkable products because we believe safe is risky."

What do your people already believe that makes them YOUR people?

### Step 3: Understand Your Role as Leader

Godin's view of tribe leadership:

| Leadership Is | Leadership Is Not |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Creating change | Maintaining status quo |
| Challenging the status quo | Managing what exists |
| Connecting people | Broadcasting to people |
| Giving people something to believe in | Giving people something to buy |
| Heresy | Compliance |

**Key insight:** "The Beatles did not invent teenagers. They merely decided to lead them."

You're not creating new desire. You're connecting people who already yearn for something.

### Step 4: Design the Connection Architecture

How do tribe members:

| Connection Type | Mechanism |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Connect to the idea** | {how they encounter and internalize the belief} |
| **Connect to you** | {how they hear from/interact with you} |
| **Connect to each other** | {how they find and talk to each other} |

The third is most important. Tribes that only flow through the leader are fragile. Tribes where members connect directly are durable.

### Step 5: Create Something to Do

"Something to do - the fewer limits, the better."

| Action Level | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| **Low barrier** | Share, comment, subscribe |
| **Medium barrier** | Create content, attend events, introduce others |
| **High barrier** | Lead sub-groups, create local chapters, take public stands |

Give people at all levels a way to participate.

### Step 6: Remember the 1,000 True Fans Rule

Kevin Kelly (cited by Godin): "You don't need everyone. You just need a thousand true fans."

**True fans:**
- Would be genuinely upset if you disappeared
- Buy everything you create
- Tell others about you
- Not "followers" - believers

Start there. Not with millions. With 1,000 who care deeply.

## Outputs

Deliver a structured framework:

```markdown
## Tribe Building Framework

### The Core

**The shared belief:**
> "People like us ______ because we believe ______."

**The change you're leading:**
{what's different because of this tribe}

### The Three Elements

**1. The Narrative**
{the story about who we are and where we're going}

**2. The Connection Architecture**
- To the idea: {mechanism}
- To the leader: {mechanism}
- To each other: {mechanism}

**3. Something to Do**
- Low barrier: {action}
- Medium barrier: {action}
- High barrier: {action}

### Leadership Posture

**You're challenging:** {what status quo}
**You're not:** {what you're NOT doing}
**Your role:** {connector, not controller}

### The First 1,000

**Who are they specifically:**
{description of true fans}

**Where do they already gather:**
{existing spaces}

**How to reach the first 10:**
{specific outreach}

### Growth Path

**From 0 to 10:** Personal outreach, one at a time
**From 10 to 100:** Those 10 bring others
**From 100 to 1,000:** Members connect members
**Beyond 1,000:** The tribe grows itself

### Remember

> "A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea."

Which connection are you building today?
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No clear shared belief | Help identify what potential members already believe |
| Wants millions immediately | Redirect to 1,000 true fans first |
| Leader-centric, not member-centric | Challenge: how do members connect to each other? |
| Manipulative intent | Decline; tribes require authentic belief |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I want to build a community around my productivity newsletter."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Tribe Building Framework

### The Core

**The shared belief:**
> "People like us ship our work instead of perfecting it because we believe done is better than perfect."

**The change you're leading:**
From: Productivity theater (tools, systems, optimization)
To: Actually finishing and shipping meaningful work

### The Three Elements

**1. The Narrative**
"We're not productivity nerds optimizing our systems. We're shippers who get real things done. The world is full of people polishing their Notion setups. We're the ones who closed the laptop and shipped."

**2. The Connection Architecture**
- To the idea: Weekly newsletter with one actionable shipping challenge
- To the leader: Reply-to-email relationship; you read and respond
- To each other: Monthly "shipped it" thread where subscribers share what they completed

**3. Something to Do**
- Low barrier: Reply to newsletter with what you shipped this week
- Medium barrier: Post your shipped work publicly with a shared hashtag
- High barrier: Host a local "ship it" accountability group

### Leadership Posture

**You're challenging:** Productivity culture that never produces
**You're not:** Another productivity guru with a system
**Your role:** The person who reminds them to ship, not the expert who tells them how

### The First 1,000

**Who are they specifically:**
Creators (writers, developers, designers) who have half-finished projects and feel guilty about it

**Where do they already gather:**
Indie Hackers, certain Twitter/X communities, Substack Notes, maker communities

**How to reach the first 10:**
Find 10 people who tweeted about unfinished projects. Send a personal email: "I noticed your thread about your unfinished [X]. I'm building a community of shippers. Want in?"

### Growth Path

**From 0 to 10:** Personal outreach to people who already resonate
**From 10 to 100:** "Tell one person who needs to ship"
**From 100 to 1,000:** Monthly shipping showcase builds social proof
**Beyond 1,000:** Members become evangelists for "ship it" culture

### Remember

> "A tribe is a group of people connected to one another, connected to a leader, and connected to an idea."

Start with the connection between members. That's what makes it a tribe, not an audience.
